# Video-Game-Database
Semester-long group project to design and maintain a large database. Utilized data modeling, the relational model, and SQL. Developed a Python front-end that allowed users to modify their data. 

Python application is in the main.py and command_entry.py files.
SQL statements and other documentation like the database's EER diagram and reduction to tables are in the documentation folder. The documentation folder also contains a presentation on the project that I made for an interview.
